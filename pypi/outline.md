# Cheat sheet: Publishing a Python Package

Or: Notes to myself to make this easier next time

**tl;dr:** TODO

# Why?

 - Writing and publishing a package is a surprisingly rough process. 
 - Fast.ai lecture
 - Wanted to experience writing and releasing a package

# Default path

 - Choosing battles
 - Won't focus on writing code
 - Be wary of need to have, nice to have. Feature creep rabbit hole
 
## Active Development

 - Setup.py
 - Documentation & documentation hosting
   - Hosting: https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html
   - Generating documentation: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/, with autodoc
   - Markdown rendering: m2r
 - Unit tests (?)
