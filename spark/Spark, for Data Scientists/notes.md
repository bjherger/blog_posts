# Spark, for Data Scientists

Spark: Data Science at Scale (?)

## Meta

Audience

 - Data scientists
   - Probably familiar w/ Python or R
   - Interested in handling larger data sets
 - Interested in Spark
 - Interested in buzz words

## Outline

Easy things should be easy, and hard things should be possible.

â€“ Larry Wall, 
Father of Perl programming language

Intro blurb

 - Look to spark to handle data at scale
 - Speed of development
 - Holistic data environment

Credibility

 - Auth fraud
 - AmpLab
 - Committers & community
 
Spark's audience

 - Originally project through AmpLab
 - Built by distributed systems engineers, for data scientists

Spark's design goals

 - Fast
 - Scalable
 - Portable
 - Usable

Shortcomings

 - Need to set up cluster
 - Added complexity
 - Natively written in Scala, w/ Python & R wrappers
 - Can be slower on smaller data sets

Getting started

 - Leave setting up Spark to the professionals 
   - Future blog post, for now look at domino data labs or data bricks
 - API similar to pandas and SKLearn / data.table
    - In many ways an improvement
 - Accept that it'll be a paradigm shift, not a 1 for 1 replacement
