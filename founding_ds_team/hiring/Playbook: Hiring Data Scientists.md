# Playbook: Hiring Data Scientists

The Data Science market is unreasonably hot, as data changes the way that many companies do business. While it's cooled 
down since I finished grad school a few years ago, demand still far outstrips supply, and hiring Data Scientists can be a Herculean task. 

In a previous role, I was fortunate to have lead or audited over 200 interviews, building a team from 2 to 85 people 
over the course of a month and a half. While this hyper-growth will probably be unique in my career (as it should be)
, I've picked up a few things about selecting and supporting Data Science talent. 

## Opportunity

In a [previous post](TODO Add link), we looked at how building a Data Science practice within your company can reduce
obsolesce risks, and drive the bottom line. However, a big hurdle in that process is attracting (and retaining) Data
Science talent in a job market that is growing at an unprecedented rate. 

Well chosen Data Scientists can be worth their weight in gold, helping to gain value from your existing data, empower
 blue-skies projects, and increase data literacy within your ranks. Good Data Scientists tend to be swiss army knives
of software engineering, data engineering and machine learning, this versatility can make them valuable assets.  

## Steps

Thoughtfully assembling a team of data scientists is no small feat, and below is a battle tested playbook for hiring 
Data Scientists.

### Define role(s)

`Data Science` is a dangerously broad and vague term, and this vagueness can really damaging as employers and 
employees set expectations. While not universal, I've found it useful to use `Data Scientist` as an umbrella role, 
with three specializations: Analyst (mostly SQL and data evaluation), Data Engineer (mostly data warehousing and 
data transformations) and Machine Learning Engineer (mostly data modeling and machine learning). While even these 
specializations share overlap, an `Analyst (Data Science team)` opening is more likely to result in qualified and 
interested candidates than an overly broad `Data Scientist` opening. It'll also help ease conversations around 
required skills, compensation and career growth. 

Defining these specializations will also allow your candidates to begin forming an efficient assembly line, rather 
than tripping over each other with overlapping responsibilities. 

One possible exception to this rule are very small teams, where team members where all three specialization hats. 
Just be aware that if you're looking for a Data Scientist unicorn, you should also be prepared to fight (and pay) for 
(and pay) for one. Also, folks who can fill all three specializations tend to be drawn towards the `Machine Learning 
Engineer` title. 

### Build a funnel

Once you have your roles defined, start building out a funnel, so that you can efficiently sort through and hire 
candidates. A common funnel might look like:

 - Entry (sourcer / referral / cold application)
 - Non-technical phone screen (culture check, broad skill check w/ a recruiter)
 - Technical phone screen (culture check, see if candidate has enough technical skills to justify an on site)
 - On site (4-8 interviews, including technical and non-technical interviews)
 - Post-on site (Discuss candidate's feedback and expectations, make offer)
 - First day (balloons; there should really be balloons on everyone's first day)
 
In my experience, this process is oddly universal, from 2 person startups to 40,000 person companies. As you're 
hiring candidates, make sure to get feedback about pain points, and continue iterating.  

### Attract talent

Now we're picking up steam! Now that you've got a funnel, the tricky step is getting candidates. 

Most shops will naturally lean towards inorganic leads, such as sourcers and head hunters. These can be expensive, 
and usually only result in candidates who respond to form emails. Also, if they've responded to your form email, 
they'll probably respond to 20 others. 

Instead, I'd recommend focusing on organic leads, like you might find at conferences, conference speaker's receptions, 
meetups, and in your rolodex. These folks are less likely to be bombarded with competing offers, and already part of 
the Data Science community. [Giving away breakfast at bus stops](https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Bigcommerce-tries-poaching-tech-workers-at-S-F-5378102.php) 
isn't recommended, but might be effective.  

### Interview

Using interviews to consistently evaluate candidates is incredibly tough. Calibration changes from person to person, 
and from day to day. I've seen great candidates be declined because their interviewer saw them as a threat, and 
I've seen awful candidates get hired (and later fired) because the interviewer was making a political play. I've seen
 alright candidates get passed on because their interviewer wasn't prepared to lead the interview, and defaulted to 
 'No'.  

I won't delve to far into how to evaluate a candidate's skills and value, because there is no silver bullet. Rather, 
I'd recommend creating a process that is:

 - Consistent, with every candidate receiving roughly the same scrutiny, regardless of interviewer / date / background
 - Fair, with every candidate evaluated on areas where they can shine, as well as areas where they only need 
 moderate skill
 - Unbiased, with every interviewer uninfluenced by previous interviewer's comments
 
While not perfect, these principles allow your team to find candidates that shine in one skill set, even if they're 
only 'OK' in other skillsets. Documenting these practices also can help in highly regulated verticals, such as 
finance or government contracting.   

### Offer

Now that you've got a candidate that you want, you need to land them. Keep in mind that an attractive offer compensation 
can include pay, equity, mentorship, travel policy, a work-from-home policy, a continuing education budget, and fancy 
office coffee. Find out what's important to your candidate, and it could make your offer a lot more attractive (and 
keep payroll lighter). 

## Lessons Learned

Before you go and conquer the world, there are a few last lessons learned that might be helpful:

### Diverse backgrounds make for strong teams

It is far to common to for Data Science teams to be made up exclusively of pure-math PhDs, college drop outs, or 
astrophysicists; in the interview process, like tends to attract like. However, some of the most successful teams 
I've met or worked with share a diversity of backgrounds, from high school dropouts to Kaggle grand masters to PhDs. 
As your training interviewers, acknowledge that its easier to say yes to candidates with similar backgrounds, and 
make an effort to tap into diverse talent pools. Women who tech, gays in tech, and boot camps tend to be great 
resources for finding able candidates that you might not see otherwise. 

### Know seasonal flows

 - January: Students start looking for jobs, for start dates in early Summer
 - January to March: Bonuses hit, promotions are missed, and annual reviews culminate. All of these can cause folks to 
 enter the market
 - June & November: Technical conferences usually accept sponsors and talk proposals starting in June (for October / 
 November conferences) and November (for April conferences). As with all things, a kind email or lunch meeting can 
 usually smooth over any missed deadlines.  
 - December: Getting anything scheduled during the holidays requires divine intervention
 - December: Some candidates take the holiday break to spend time preparing for and applying to new jobs 

## Go forth, and conquer

Now that you've got your playbook, go forth and hire. Your future Data Scientists are out there, it's just a matter 
of finding them.
